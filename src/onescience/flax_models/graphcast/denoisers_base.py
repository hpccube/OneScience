"""Base class for Denoisers used in diffusion Predictors.

Denoisers are a bit like deterministic Predictors, except:
* Their __call__ method also conditions on noisy_targets and the noise_levels
  of those noisy targets
* They don't have an overrideable loss function (the loss is assumed to be some
  form of MSE and is implemented outside the Denoiser itself)

        added to them (where the noise level used may vary along the 'batch'
